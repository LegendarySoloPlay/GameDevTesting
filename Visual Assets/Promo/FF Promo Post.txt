Hey all!

I'm thrilled to be back with another update to my browser-based solo version of Marvel Legendary and our next expansion: Fantastic Four! 😁

In addition to Marvel's First Family, the cosmic threat of Galactus and more, I've also done some major overhauls: 

⭐ Theme and Font Customization - Not just a simple Light/Dark mode - you can select from expansion-styled themes and fonts.
⭐ Animations - Villain attacks and Hero recruits are now animated.
⭐ Restart Mechanics - Many of you have asked for a Restart button - it was a little trickier than anticipated but I found a solution! The Game Setup screen now features a 'Load Last Setup' button than will auto-select your choices from last game.
